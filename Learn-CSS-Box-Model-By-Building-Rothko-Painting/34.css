Step 34
The colors and shapes of your painting are too sharp to pass as a Rothko.

Use the filter property to blur the painting by 2px in the .canvas element.

Here's an example of a rule that add a 3px blur:

p {
  filter: blur(3px);
}
Sol:-
.canvas {
  width: 500px;
  height: 600px;
  background-color: #4d0f00;
  overflow: hidden;
filter:blur(2px);
}
