Step 19
Nutrition labels have a lot of bold text to draw attention to important information. Rather than targeting each element that needs to be bold, it is more efficient to use a class to apply the bold styling to every element.

Give your second p element a class attribute set to bold.

Sol:-
 <div class="label">
    <h1>Nutrition Facts</h1>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p>8 servings per container</p>
    <p class="bold">Serving size 2/3 cup (55g)</p>
  </div>
