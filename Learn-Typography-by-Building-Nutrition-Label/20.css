Your new class does not have any styling yet. Create a .bold selector and give it a font-weight property set to 800 to make the text bold.

Go ahead and remove the font-weight property from your h1 selector as well.

Sol:-
h1 {
  text-align: center;
  margin: -4px 0;
  letter-spacing: 0.15px;
}

p {
  margin: 0;
}
.bold{
  font-weight:800;
}
