Currently, the img is assuming its default size, which is too large. CSS has a max function which returns the largest of a set of comma-separated values. For example:

img {
  width: max(250px, 25vw);
}
In this example, img elements will have a minimum width of 250px. And as the viewport grows, the image will grow accordingly to be 25 percent of the viewport width.

Scale the image using its id as a selector, and setting the width to be the maximum of 100px or 18vw.

Sol:-
#logo{
  width:max(100px,18vw);
}
