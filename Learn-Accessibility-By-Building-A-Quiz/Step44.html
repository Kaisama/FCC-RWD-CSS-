The address element does not have to contain a physical geographical location. It can be used to provide a link to the subject.

Wrap a link around the text freeCodeCamp, and set its location to https://freecodecamp.org.

Sol:-
    <footer>
      <address>
        <a href="https://freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp</a><br />
        San Francisco<br />
        California<br />
        USA
      </address>
    </footer>
