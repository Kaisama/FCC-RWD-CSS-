For example, a media query that targets a display width between 500px and 1000px would be:

@media (min-width: 500px) and (max-width: 1000px){

}
Add another @media rule to apply if the browser window is wider than 769px but smaller than 1199px.

Sol:-
@media(min-width:769px)and (max-width:1199px){

}
