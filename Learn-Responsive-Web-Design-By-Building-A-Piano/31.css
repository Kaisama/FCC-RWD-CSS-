You might have noticed the keys collapse when the browser window is smaller than 768px. Set overflow to hidden in the first .keys selector, to take care of this issue. This property will hide any element that is pushed outside the set width value of .keys.

Sol:-
.keys {
  background-color: #040404;
  width: 949px;
  height: 180px;
  padding-left: 2px;
  overflow:hidden;
}
